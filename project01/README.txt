->use DJI_20230124113730_0001_W_Waypoint1.srt file

->Extracted Time Code, Frame Number, Latitude, Longitude, and Altitude from the SRT file.

->Time Code column consists of start time and end time.

->Calculate the distance between two points on Earth given their latitude and longitude coordinates, using Haversine formula(in kilometers).

->This distance calculated from the starting point to each point.

->calculate the speed from the starting point to a paticular point (row wise)(km per hour).

->finally create a dataframe with all seven attributes including distance and speed.

->you can use either csv format or json format.
